## Overview

This project utilizes various sensors, actuators, and communication modules controlled by the ESP32 to provide features like:

- **WiFi Connectivity** for remote monitoring via **MQTT**.
- **Temperature & Humidity Monitoring** with the **DHT22 sensor**.
- **Light Intensity Measurement** via **LDRs**, adjusting a servo motor as necessary.
- **Buzzer Notifications** for reminding users to take their medication on time.
- **Button Interface** for user interaction like canceling alarms or confirming actions.

## Features

- **WiFi Connectivity**: Remote monitoring and control via **MQTT**.
- **Temperature & Humidity Monitoring**: Environmental tracking with **DHT22**.
- **Light Intensity Measurement**: **LDR** sensors to adjust **servo motor** based on light.
- **Servo Motor Control**: Automatically adjusts a shaded window based on ambient light.
- **Buzzer Notifications**: Audio alerts for scheduled medication times.
- **Button Interface**: Manual control for confirming actions or canceling alarms.
- **Customizable Settings**: Control **servo motor angles** and other parameters via **MQTT**.

---

## Components

- **ESP32**: Main microcontroller.
- **DHT22**: Sensor for temperature and humidity.
- **LDRs**: For detecting ambient light levels.
- **Servo Motor**: Moves a shaded window according to light levels.
- **Buzzer**: Provides audio notifications.
- **Buttons**: For manual user input and interaction.

## How It Works

The **ESP32 Medibox** helps users manage their medication schedules with real-time monitoring and notifications:

1. **Environmental Monitoring**: Constantly measures **temperature**, **humidity**, and **light intensity**.
2. **Reminders**: Uses a **buzzer** to notify users when itâ€™s time to take medication.
3. **Remote Monitoring**: Users can monitor and control the device remotely using **MQTT**.
4. **Customizable Settings**: Adjust servo motor parameters (e.g., minimum angle) via MQTT.

## MQTT Topics

The following MQTT topics are used in this project:

| Topic            | Description                                         |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `MQTT-ON-OFF`    | Controls the buzzer (ON/OFF).                       |
| `MQTT-SCH-ON`    | Manages the schedule for buzzer notifications.      |
| `MQTT-TEMP`      | Receives temperature readings.                      |
| `MQTT-LDR`       | Receives light intensity data.                      |
| `MQTT-MIN-ANG`   | Sets the minimum angle of the servo motor.          |
| `MQTT-CTRL-FAC`  | Sets the controlling factor for the servo motor.    |
| `MQTT-DROP-DOWN` | Selects predefined settings for the servo motor.    |
